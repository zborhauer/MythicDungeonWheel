# Wheel Mode Button Removal - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mode Toggle Button from XML
- Completely removed the `MythicDungeonWheelModeToggle` button from `MythicDungeonWheel.xml`
- Button was previously located in the top-right corner of the interface

### 2. Removed Mode Toggle Functionality from Lua
- Removed `ToggleInterfaceMode()` function entirely
- Removed all references to `MythicDungeonWheelModeToggle` button in the Lua code
- Removed mode toggle from UI initialization

### 3. Simplified Interface Mode Logic
- **Before:** Users could toggle between "list" mode (instant selection) and "wheel" mode (animated selection)
- **After:** Interface always uses "wheel" mode with scrolling animation
- Removed conditional logic that checked `self.interfaceMode == "wheel"`

### 4. Updated Selection Logic
- **Before:** 
  ```lua
  if self.interfaceMode == "wheel" then
      self:StartScrollingAnimation(keystoneList)
  else
      -- Instant selection for list mode
  end
  ```
- **After:**
  ```lua
  -- Use scrolling animation for all selections
  self:StartScrollingAnimation(keystoneList)
  ```

### 5. Updated Interface Initialization
- Changed default interface mode from "list" to "wheel"
- Updated debug message to reflect the simplified approach
- Removed mode toggle button from UI references

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience:** No confusing mode switching - users get the engaging scrolling animation every time
2. **Cleaner Interface:** Removed the mode toggle button, giving more space for keystone list
3. **Consistent Behavior:** All keystone selections now use the same animated approach
4. **Reduced Complexity:** Less code to maintain, fewer UI elements to manage
5. **Better UX:** The scrolling animation is more engaging than instant selection anyway

## Current Behavior

- Interface always shows the keystone list (same as before)
- Clicking "Select Random" always triggers the scrolling animation
- Green highlighting shows current selection during animation
- Gold highlighting shows final selection
- No mode switching options available

The addon now provides a single, consistent, and engaging way to select keystones with the scrolling animation being the default (and only) selection method.
