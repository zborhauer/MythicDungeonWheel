# Mythic Dungeon Wheel

A World of Warcraft addon that provides an engaging and democratic way for groups to randomly select keystones for Mythic+ dungeons using a smooth scrolling animation and group voting system.

## What This Addon Does

**Mythic Dungeon Wheel** transforms the keystone selection process from "who speaks first" to a fair, animated, and democratic experience. Instead of debating which key to run, simply add all available keystones to a session and let the wheel decide! The addon features:

- **Animated Keystone Selection**: A smooth scrolling animation that builds suspense before revealing the chosen keystone
- **Democratic Voting System**: After a keystone is selected, the group votes whether to accept the wheel's decision
- **Session Management**: Create collaborative sessions where participants can join, leave, and contribute keystones
- **Smart Leave System**: Participants can cleanly leave sessions without disrupting the experience
- **Cross-Client Synchronization**: All party members see the same animation and results simultaneously

## Key Features

### üéØ **Core Functionality**
- **Democratic Session Management**: Any party member can start sessions; participants can join and leave freely
- **Automated Keystone Detection**: Scans your bags and displays available keystones automatically  
- **Animated Selection Process**: Engaging scrolling animation that gradually slows down before selection
- **Group Voting System**: After selection, the group votes to accept or reject the wheel's choice
- **Session Participant Management**: Clean join/leave system with proper state management

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety & Control**
- **Animation Lock**: Prevents keystone changes during the selection animation
- **Voting Lock**: Blocks leaving sessions during active votes

### üé® **User Experience**

- **Clean UI**: Intuitive interface showing session status, available keystones, and voting results
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded keystone highlighting (green for selected, gray for others)
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks how often groups obey or disobey the wheel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No keystones found"
- **Solution**: Make sure you have Mythic Keystone items in your bags
- **Debug**: Use `/mdw debug` then `/mdw scan` to force a bag scan
- **Test**: Enable test mode with `/mdw test` to add fake keystones

#### "Cannot start session"
- **Solution**: You need to be in a party or raid group (or enable test mode)
- **Check**: Verify you're in a group with `/who`
- **Test**: Use `/mdw test` to enable solo testing

#### Interface not showing
- **Solution**: Type `/mdw` to toggle the interface
- **Reset**: Try `/reload` to refresh the UI
- **Check**: Look for the minimap button (dice or question mark icon)

#### Voting not working
- **Solution**: Ensure all participants are in the same group and have the addon
- **Check**: Verify voting window appears after keystone selection
- **Debug**: Enable debug mode to see voting status messages

#### Animation desynchronized
- **Solution**: This typically self-corrects; ensure all players have the addon
- **Reset**: Use `/mdw reset` to clear the session and start fresh
- **Update**: Ensure all players have the same addon version

### Debug Information

Enable debug mode with `/mdw debug` to see:
- Keystone detection details
