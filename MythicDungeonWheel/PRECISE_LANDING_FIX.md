# Fixed Animation Landing - Update Summary

## Problem Solved

**Before:** Animation would run for exactly 5 seconds and then jump to a pre-selected "winner", regardless of where the highlight currently was.

**After:** Animation calculates the exact path needed to land on the selected winner, ensuring it visually stops exactly on the chosen keystone.

## How It Now Works

### Step-Based Animation
1. **Pre-calculates the target:** Finds which position in the list corresponds to the randomly selected winner
2. **Calculates minimum steps:** Ensures at least 5 seconds of animation by calculating minimum steps needed
3. **Adds extra cycles:** Adds full cycles through the list to build suspense
4. **Lands precisely:** Animation stops exactly when it reaches the target position

### Technical Implementation

**Target Position Calculation:**
```lua
-- Find which position in sessionKeystones corresponds to our selected keystone
local targetPosition = 1
for i, button in ipairs(sessionKeystones) do
    if button.keystone matches selectedKeystone then
        targetPosition = i
        break
    end
end
```

**Total Steps Calculation:**
```lua
local minSteps = math.ceil(minDuration / baseSpeed) -- Steps for 5+ seconds
local extraCycles = math.ceil(minSteps / #sessionKeystones) -- Full extra cycles
local totalSteps = extraCycles * #sessionKeystones + (targetPosition - 1)
```

### Animation Characteristics

**Duration:** Minimum 5 seconds, but can be 6-7 seconds if needed to land on winner
**Path:** Scrolls down through list, cycles back to top, continues until landing on target
**Speed:** Starts fast, dramatically slows down with cubic easing
**Precision:** Stops exactly on the selected keystone, not randomly

### User Experience

- **Visual Satisfaction:** Users see the highlight actually land on the winner
- **No Jumping:** Smooth, continuous scrolling that logically ends on the selection
- **Variable Duration:** Duration naturally varies (5-7 seconds) based on where winner is located
- **Build-up:** Extra cycles through the list build anticipation before landing
- **Clear Landing:** Green highlight transitions to gold exactly where it stops

This creates the authentic "slot machine" or "wheel of fortune" experience where you can see it actually land on the winner rather than jumping to a predetermined result.
