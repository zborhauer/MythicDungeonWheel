# Scrolling Animation Update - Changes Made

## Overview
Removed the complex Counter Strike style case opening animation and replaced it with a simple scrolling list animation that highlights keystones as it scrolls through them.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management Changes (`MythicDungeonWheel.lua`)

**Removed:**
- `MDW.slotMachine` state object with items, selectedKeystone, and isAnimating properties

**Added:**
- `MDW.scrollingAnimation` state object with simpler isAnimating and selectedKeystone properties

### 2. Selection Logic Changes

**Modified `SelectRandomKeystone` function:**
- Changed from `StartSlotMachineAnimation()` to `StartScrollingAnimation(keystoneList)` for wheel mode
- Wheel mode now passes the keystone list to the animation function
- List mode behavior remains unchanged (instant selection)

### 3. Animation Implementation

**Removed Functions:**
- `ShowSlotMachine()` - Showed/hid complex slot machine UI elements
- `HideSlotMachine()` - Cleanup for slot machine elements  
- `InitializeSlotMachine()` - Created visual dungeon frames with textures
- `StartSlotMachineAnimation()` - Complex CS2-style spinning animation
- `ShowSlotMachineResult()` - Result display for slot machine

**Added Functions:**
- `StartScrollingAnimation(keystoneList)` - Simple scrolling animation through the existing keystone list
- `FinishScrollingAnimation()` - Handles final selection and highlighting

### 4. Animation Behavior

**New Scrolling Animation:**
- Uses the existing keystone list UI instead of creating new visual elements
- Highlights keystones in green as it scrolls through them
- Starts fast and gradually slows down over 3 seconds
- Final selection highlighted in gold
- Animation clears highlighting after 3 seconds

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes existing UI elements (no new frames created)
- Green highlighting during animation indicates current "selected" option
- Gold highlighting for final selection
- Smooth easing animation (starts fast, slows down)
- Works with the same keystone list shown in list mode

### 5. UI Changes

**Keystone List Enhancement:**
- Added background textures (`button.bg`) to session keystone entries
- Background allows for highlighting during animation
- Default gray background (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.8)
- Green highlight during scrolling (0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 0.9)
- Gold highlight for final selection (0.8, 0.6, 0.2, 0.9)

**XML Changes:**
- Removed entire slot machine interface from `MythicDungeonWheel.xml`
- Removed MythicDungeonWheelSlotMachine frame
- Removed MythicDungeonWheelSlotViewport, SlotContainer, SlotIndicator, SlotResult frames
- Kept mode toggle button functionality

### 6. Interface Mode Toggle

**Simplified `ToggleInterfaceMode()`:**
- Removed slot machine show/hide logic
- Now only toggles interface mode flag and button text
- Both modes use the same UI (keystone list)
- Only difference is selection behavior (instant vs animated)

### 7. Code Cleanup

**Removed:**
- All slot machine UI references
- Complex texture loading and dungeon frame creation
- Counter Strike style visual effects
- Slot machine result display

**Retained:**
- Dungeon texture helper functions (still used elsewhere)
- All list mode functionality
- Session management
- Communication between players

## Testing

A test file `TestScrolling.lua` was created to verify:
- Scrolling animation state initialization
- Function existence
- Interface mode settings

Use `/mdwtest` command to run basic functionality checks.

## Benefits of New Implementation

1. **Simpler Codebase:** Removed ~300 lines of complex animation code
2. **Better UX:** Uses familiar list interface instead of confusing slot machine
3. **Clearer Feedback:** Green highlighting clearly shows current selection
4. **Maintained Excitement:** Still has anticipation with scrolling animation
5. **Easier Maintenance:** Fewer UI elements to manage
6. **Better Performance:** No complex texture loading or frame creation

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Select Random" in wheel mode
2. `StartScrollingAnimation()` is called with available keystones
3. Animation randomly selects final result upfront
4. Visual animation scrolls through keystone list with green highlighting
5. Animation slows down over 3 seconds using easing function
6. Final selection is highlighted in gold
7. Session continues normally with selected keystone
8. Highlighting clears after 3 seconds

The wheel mode now provides a simple, clear, and engaging way to select keystones without the complexity of the previous Counter Strike style implementation.
