## Development Notes

### Architecture
The addon is built with a modular approach:
- **Core Logic**: Session management and keystone handling
- **UI System**: XML-defined frames with Lua event handling  
- **Communication**: Custom protocol over WoW's addon message system
- **Testing**: Built-in test mode for development and debugging

### Code Structure
```
MythicDungeonWheel.toc     - Addon metadata and file loading
MythicDungeonWheel.lua     - Main addon logic and functionality
MythicDungeonWheel.xml     - User interface definition
README.md                  - User documentation
TestScript.lua             - Development testing utilities
CHANGELOG.md               - Version history and changes
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Individual function validation
2. **Integration Testing**: Cross-player communication
3. **UI Testing**: Interface responsiveness and updates
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Error conditions and invalid states
5. **Performance Testing**: Memory usage and responsiveness

### Contributing
- Follow WoW addon best practices
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Test all changes in both solo and group environments
- Document new features and API changes
- Use test mode for development validation
