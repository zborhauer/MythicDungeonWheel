# Scrolling Animation Enhancement - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### Enhanced Scrolling Animation Behavior

**Duration Changed:**
- **Before:** 3 seconds
- **After:** 5 seconds (more time to build anticipation)

**Visual Scrolling Pattern:**
- **Before:** Random jumping between keystones
- **After:** Continuous scrolling down through the list, cycling back to top when reaching bottom

**Speed and Easing:**
- **Before:** Linear easing with minimum speed
- **After:** Dramatic cubic easing (starts very fast, slows down dramatically)
- Uses `(1 - progress)^3` for exponential slowdown
- Time between highlights: 0.05s (fast) to 0.55s (very slow)

**Selection Display Integration:**
- **Before:** Selection box only showed result after animation
- **After:** Selection box shows currently highlighted keystone during animation
- Text changes from "Rolling: [keystone]" during animation to "Selected: [keystone]" when finished

### Technical Implementation

**Filtering Logic:**
- Only animates through session keystones (buttons with `button.keystone` property)
- Skips "Add keystone" buttons which don't have the keystone property
- Ensures smooth cycling through actual selectable options

**Animation Flow:**
1. Start with first session keystone highlighted
2. Move down through the list one by one
3. When reaching the last keystone, cycle back to first
4. Speed decreases dramatically over 5 seconds
5. Currently highlighted keystone shows in selection box with "Rolling:" prefix
6. Final selection highlights in gold with "Selected:" prefix

**Display Updates:**
- **During Animation:** Green highlight + "Rolling: [Player]'s +[Level] [Dungeon]"
- **Final Selection:** Gold highlight + "Selected: [Player]'s +[Level] [Dungeon]"
- Selection box remains visible throughout entire process

## User Experience

**Visual Feedback:**
- Clear progression down the list (easy to follow)
- Builds anticipation as it slows down dramatically
- Live preview of what keystone is currently being "considered"
- Satisfying final selection with color change and text update

**Timing:**
- 5 seconds provides good build-up without being too long
- Exponential slowdown creates natural "selection moment"
- Final 1-2 seconds move very slowly for maximum suspense

**Clarity:**
- Users can see the selection process happening in real-time
- No confusion about which keystone is being considered
- Clear distinction between "rolling" and "selected" states

This implementation provides the exciting, casino-like rolling effect you wanted while maintaining clear visual feedback and building proper anticipation through the 5-second duration and dramatic speed reduction.
